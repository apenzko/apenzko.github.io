It was really fun to offer a workshop for <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/study/study-choice/girls-day/">Girls' Day 2025</a> as part of SimTech. In the workshop we built a machine learning model and integrated it into a graphical interface with Scratch, a block-based programming language. The 10 girls from 5th and 6th grade did a great job and were able to train their own image classifier via <a href="https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/">https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/</a>. I'm looking forward to contributing again next year!
