Machine understanding of human behavior and cognition has significant potential for a new generation of intelligent user interfaces that offer human-like collaborative, social, and conversational capabilities. Computational Theory of Mind and Cognition are key for building such intelligent interactive systems.

The goal of this practical course is to familiarize students with exciting current research topics at the intersection of machine learning, computational cognitive modelling, and human-computer interaction. After having completed the course, students will have acquired theoretical knowledge about the most important problems in machine understanding of human behavior and cognition and how to leverage such understanding in the design of intelligent user interfaces. The core competency acquired through this course is the ability to implement latest machine learning methods (e.g. deep and spiking neural networks, transformers etc.) that address the processing and interpretation of human input in computing systems and evaluate them on state-of-the-art datasets.
